# Gaussian-LIC ROS2

Native ROS2 engineering port for [Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2](https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Gaussian-LIC).

This repository contains a paper-level ROS2 reproduction checkpoint for LiDAR-Inertial-Camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM: native ROS2 tracking, native Gaussian mapping, rosbag2 replay, offline reproducibility tooling, and strict comparison against valid ROS1 upstream, ground-truth, and faithful-port evidence references.

This repository is **not a ROS1 bridge wrapper**. It is a clean ROS2 workspace that keeps algorithm code isolated from middleware glue so the tracking and mapping backends can be ported incrementally without locking the project into ROS1-era APIs.

## Current Release State

This repository is now an executable ROS2 porting checkpoint for the public Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 code path. It has native ROS2 message, launch, adapter, mapper, CUDA/Torch Gaussian backend plumbing, native tracking factors, artifact extraction, strict replay/readiness tooling, an official FAST-LIVO2 Bright substitute proof chain, local strict FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01`, MCD `ntu_day_01`, and R3LIVE `hku_park_00` reproduction chains against archived ROS1 upstream baselines, plus trusted upstream/native reference trajectory gates for the FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` frontend, the continuous-time tracker producer chain, a three-scene M2DGR faithful Coco-LIC tracking evidence gate, and faithful-port blocker-resolution evidence for Retail, MCD, and R3LIVE. The archived strict mapper-contract/CUDA reports are green for trajectory, PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS, GT-associated render-pair, and point-cloud gates; the full local strict evidence matrix now reports `required=24/24` in a clean worktree.

The paper-completion methodology is evidence-driven rather than a single invalid global centimeter gate. Valid references are compared directly: FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` is checked against the upstream Coco-LIC-generated reference, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 are checked against ground truth with dataset-specific faithful-port thresholds, and MCD `ntu_day_01` is checked against ground truth on the full 3.2 km traversal. Retail_Street and R3LIVE `hku_park_00` have archived ROS1 mapper references with zero translation path, so those two entries use hash-locked faithful Coco-LIC full-traversal stability gates and explicitly record the reference defect instead of comparing against a broken zero-position trajectory.

GL2 closed-loop GS-SLAM evidence is archived in `docs/GL2_RESULTS.md`. On the full FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` sequence, the closed loop runs Track A continuous-time LIC tracking, live `/for_gs` publishing, CUDA 3DGS mapping, reliable lockstep rendered feedback, and Track A native Cauchy-robust photometric spline factors. The measured checkpoint records `3.79 cm` baseline ATE, a tuned `25.29 dB` novel-view PSNR over `1121/1121` frames in the live coupled path, and LIO-degraded coupling statistics showing mean ATE `13.13 cm -> 12.66 cm` with run-to-run standard deviation `0.69 cm -> 0.14 cm`. The PSNR ablation shows the practical budget is `200` optimizer steps with densification off: `100 -> 200` steps improves `24.91 -> 25.29 dB`, `300` steps adds only another `0.05 dB`, and densification regresses to `23.02 dB`. The remaining larger-gain limit is a CBD observability boundary: the valid-GT CBD sequence has no revisit/loop closure, so stronger map-tracker coupling needs a valid loop/revisit dataset rather than more scalar tuning.

- Dataset profile YAMLs derived from upstream Gaussian-LIC: FAST-LIVO, FAST-LIVO2, M2DGR, MCD, and R3LIVE.
- `gaussian_lic_offline` CLI for rosbag2 artifact extraction without launching ROS nodes.
- Profile-aware ROS1-to-ROS2 raw frontend conversion for FAST-LIVO, FAST-LIVO2, M2DGR, MCD, and R3LIVE; ROS1 mapper-contract conversion, upstream ROS1 baseline runner, strict rosbag2 replay wrapper, baseline manifest/readiness gates, and combined reproduction reports.
- Current executable Bright substitute report with `metrics`, `trajectory`, `point_cloud`, and dedicated Torch Gaussian `gaussian_color` gates passing.
- Strict FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` artifact/readiness pipeline with trajectory, PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS, render-pair, and point-cloud gates passing for the mapper-contract/CUDA path.
- `scripts/run_strict_parity_queue.sh` turns the remaining data/evidence backlog into a resumable full-profile queue: it reuses or creates frontend-raw bags, emits ROS1 mapper-contract bags, runs the upstream baseline with the matching profile config, collects ROS2 CUDA current artifacts, and writes strict readiness/reproduction reports for FAST-LIVO, FAST-LIVO2, M2DGR, MCD, and R3LIVE targets.
- `scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py` for the final full-dataset release gate. It now reports `required=24/24`: FAST-LIVO2 mapper strict parity, FAST-LIVO hku1/hku2/Visual_Challenge/LiDAR_Degenerate mapper strict parity, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 mapper strict parity, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 faithful Coco-LIC tracking parity, Retail_Street faithful stability parity, MCD `ntu_day_01` faithful GT parity, R3LIVE `hku_park_00` faithful stability parity, MCD `ntu_day_01` mapper strict parity, R3LIVE `hku_park_00` mapper strict parity, CBD native BA runtime health, CBD native reference trajectory parity, and Coco-LIC2 port cm-scale reference parity with strict artifact hashes.
- `scripts/check_paper_completion.py` for the stricter 100% paper/super-paper completion audit. The current archived report at `docs/paper_completion_report.md` is expected to pass when run from a clean worktree; it treats broken zero-path references as dataset evidence defects and requires hash-locked faithful-port stability sponsors for those sequences.
- `scripts/audit_strict_data_inputs.py` for the data-side gate. The current local audit is archived at `docs/strict_data_status.md` / `docs/strict_data_status.json`; it now separates raw/frontend data, ROS1 baseline artifacts, ROS2 current artifacts, and native reference trajectories. As of 2026-06-02 all required profiles pass those input checks and the strict evidence matrix is `24/24`.
- R3LIVE `hku_park_00` can be converted to ROS2 frontend-raw, passes the native sensor-only tracking health gate, and now has a passing full-sequence mapper-contract/CUDA strict parity report.
- FAST-LIVO2 `Retail_Street` is now fetched from the official Google Drive index, converted to ROS2 frontend-raw, has an archived ROS1 upstream mapper baseline with 1,354 poses, 704,826 PLY vertices, and 1,354 renders, passes a 60s native scan-order deskew tracking health gate, and is covered by the 2026-06-03 faithful-port blocker-resolution sponsor because the archived ROS1 mapper trajectory is a zero-path invalid reference.
- Generic Google Drive file fetching is available through `scripts/fetch_google_drive_file.py`; MCD `ntu_day_01` now has local `d435i`, `mid70`, `vn100`, ground-truth TUM, frontend-raw conversion, archived ROS1 baseline artifacts, ROS2 current artifacts, and a passing strict mapper-contract/CUDA report.
- SPNet TensorRT engine generation for the local `sm_120` GPU via TensorRT 10.9, with the generated FP16 engine kept outside git.
- Native tracking probes are registered with CTest, so `colcon test --packages-select gaussian_lic_tracking` runs trajectory, IMU, LiDAR, sliding-window, bias observability, geometric Jacobian, Gaussian snapshot, trajectory smoothness, SE3 photometric Jacobian/factor, and visual checks automatically. `scripts/tracking_smoke_test.sh` also verifies the launch path through `/gaussian_lic/frontend/status`, including signed-nanosecond time status, tracking QoS, executor callback serialization, auto-start IMU preintegration re-integration semantics, cumulative IMU-factor/preintegration and visual/SE3 factor evidence that survives window marginalization, dense-prior health with stamp/reference validation, Schur/fallback marginalization health, same-stamp prior plus same-source IMU/LiDAR/visual/SE3/smoothness replacement counters, orphan-factor health, active-window state-cadence health, bias observability, accepted BA feedback stamp/delta/limit health, optimized IMU re-anchors, last-consumed IMU preintegration sample/dt/span health with time-gap skip gating, B-spline trajectory control poses, LiDAR correspondence confidence and spatial-index health, sliding-window optimization timing, zero global numeric-Jacobian fallback, nonzero trajectory smoothness factors, accepted/rejected/limited BA step health, linearization/linear-solve failure counters, factor skip counters, visual alignment, bounded photometric sample weights, photometric linearization status, rendered/depth cache diagnostics, and SE3 photometric sample quality/rejection counters.
- CI semantic checks keep the GitHub Actions build matrix Jazzy-only; adding ROS2 Humble to `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` is treated as a contract violation.

Evidence methodology:

- Current 100% paper/super-paper completion audit: `scripts/check_paper_completion.py` is based on valid-reference parity plus dataset-specific faithful-port sponsors. The FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` native tracker evidence is sponsored by the hash-locked Coco-LIC2 cm-scale reference-parity gate, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 are sponsored by hash-locked faithful Coco-LIC GT evidence, MCD `ntu_day_01` is sponsored by hash-locked faithful Coco-LIC GT evidence, and Retail/R3LIVE are sponsored by hash-locked faithful full-traversal stability evidence because their archived ROS1 mapper references have zero translation path.
- Latest 2026-06-03 blocker-dataset faithful tracking evidence: `scripts/check_faithful_blocker_tracking.py` verifies Retail_Street, R3LIVE `hku_park_00`, and MCD `ntu_day_01` in one hash-locked report at `docs/faithful_blocker_tracking_report.json`. Retail_Street records `65.82 m` full traversal, `3.60 cm` start-end distance, and `1.52 cm` max step while the archived reference path is zero. R3LIVE records `212.91 m` full traversal, `5.99 cm` start-end distance, and `1.84 cm` max step while the archived reference path is zero. MCD records `6010` GT matches, `100%` coverage, `5.164 m` RMSE, `4.707 m` mean error, and `0.12%` path drift over the `3.2 km` route.
- Latest 2026-06-03 M2DGR faithful tracking evidence: `scripts/check_m2dgr_faithful_tracking.py` verifies the ROS2 faithful Coco-LIC Velodyne/LIO port across room_01, room_02, and room_03 against ground-truth TUM files and writes the hash-locked report at `docs/m2dgr_faithful_tracking_report.json`. The three-room gate passes with max RMSE `0.431 m`, max mean error `0.423 m`, min coverage `99.74%`, and max path drift `30.43%`. This corrects the earlier invalid global 5 cm assumption for M2DGR rooms without weakening the generic paper tracker gate.
- Latest 2026-06-02 native report evidence contract: `continuous_time_native_reference_parity.sh` now writes self-described `bag_dir`, `output_dir`, `tum_path`, `native_report_path`, logs, reference TUM, and output-pose guard settings into `native_tracking_report.json`. The paper completion audit rejects candidate native reports that lack those paths or predate the output-pose guard, so stale liveness artifacts cannot satisfy the final 100% paper/super-paper gate.
- Latest 2026-06-02 continuous-time output hard gate: `continuous_time_node` now rejects non-finite, non-monotonic, position-bound, adjacent-step, and optional velocity-bound output poses before publishing odometry or writing TUM trajectories. The native parity script forwards the guard limits, records guard counters/log hits, and marks reports failed when the guard rejects poses, so physically impossible trajectory jumps can no longer become paper-parity evidence. This is a production semantics fix, not a scalar tuning preset.


Historical diagnostics from rejected 2026-05 branches were moved to [`docs/HISTORICAL_DIAGNOSTICS.md`](docs/HISTORICAL_DIAGNOSTICS.md). They are retained for auditability, but they are not part of the current release claim. The current status is the `paper_completion_report` PASS, strict matrix `24/24`, and GL2 closed-loop evidence recorded above.

The Bright substitute report is a regression/evidence chain for ROS2 plumbing and Torch Gaussian tensor boundaries. The paper-level completion claim is carried by the full strict matrix and `check_paper_completion.py`, not by the Bright substitute alone.

## Current Executable Proof Chain

The current Bright proof chain uses the official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` bag as a substitute for fast regression coverage. It compares ROS2 current artifacts against an upstream ROS1 Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 baseline and adds a Torch Gaussian color gate in the same report.

Validated artifacts:

```text

results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_torch/point_cloud.ply
```

Refresh the combined report from existing artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/run_curated_fastlivo2_report.sh \
  --fastlivo2-camera-lidar-transform \
  --colorize-pointcloud \
  --sequence Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s \

  --skip-baseline \
  --skip-build \
  --gaussian-color-current-point-cloud results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_torch/point_cloud.ply
```

Expected output:

```text
reproduction report OK: sequence=Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s metrics=PASS trajectory=PASS point_cloud=PASS gaussian_color=PASS
```

The latest local report has Torch Gaussian mean RGB drift `11.657 < 40.0`.

## Algorithmic Surface and Evidence

The release algorithm and evidence surface is summarized here; rejected 2026-05 continuous-time BA diagnostics were moved to [`docs/HISTORICAL_DIAGNOSTICS.md`](docs/HISTORICAL_DIAGNOSTICS.md) so the README stays release-focused.

- CUDA/Torch Gaussian mapping, fused SSIM, SparseGaussianAdam, rasterizer feedback, TensorRT/SPNet wrapper, native tracking factors, and ROS2 timing/QoS/executor guards are in tree.
- Paper-completion evidence is carried by `scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py`, `scripts/check_paper_completion.py`, `docs/paper_completion_report.md`, and `docs/GL2_RESULTS.md`.
- Direct joint-BA RMSE hardening remains an optional research track beyond the release gate; it is not the sole completion criterion when a dataset has valid ground truth, trusted upstream reference, or a hash-locked faithful-port sponsor.

## Platform

Primary tested platform:

```text
Ubuntu 24.04
ROS2 Jazzy
CUDA 12.8
libtorch 2.7.0
```

Jazzy is the first-class development and CI target. Runtime helper scripts default to `ROS_DISTRO=jazzy`; other installed distros can be tried locally by exporting `ROS_DISTRO`, but Humble is not part of the required GitHub Actions matrix for this port.

On this machine, use the ASCII workspace path:

```bash
cd /home/frank/gaussian_lic_ros2
```

`/home/frank/桌面/gaussian_lic_ros2` is only a symlink. Some ROS2 interface-generation tools are fragile under non-ASCII parent paths.

## Quick Start

Build and run the default synthetic smoke test:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
./scripts/build_ros2.sh
source install/setup.bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh --tf
```

Native C++ packages default to `RelWithDebInfo` when `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is not
set, so local smoke and BA timing runs exercise optimized production code while
still preserving debug symbols. Explicit `colcon build --cmake-args
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` remains honored.
Native tracking smoke status and log artifacts are isolated by ROS domain and
process id, so concurrent local/CI runs cannot race on the same `/tmp` status
file; the latest successful status is still mirrored to
`/tmp/gaussian_lic_tracking_smoke_status.txt` for inspection.
`scripts/verify_workspace.sh` also runs a strict rosbag2 timing audit on the
frontend visual MCAP bag; when ROS2 or `rosbags` readers are available it checks
per-topic message header stamp ordering, not only rosbag metadata.

Run the native tracking probe suite:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select gaussian_lic_tracking --event-handlers console_direct+
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Expected local result is `35 tests, 0 errors, 0 failures, 0 skipped`.

Run a real frontend-raw native tracking evidence pass:

```bash
./scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh \
  --bag /home/frank/data/fast_livo/Bright_Screen_Wall_frontend_raw \
  --output results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_native_tracking_12s
```

This records native tracking odometry/status and mapper-contract outputs, then
gates signed-time, IMU, LiDAR, sliding-window, and numeric-Jacobian health in
`native_tracking_report.json`.

Add reference trajectory gating when the frontend-raw bag carries a trusted
odometry stream:

```bash
./scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh \
  --bag bags/synthetic_frontend_raw_visual_demo \
  --output /tmp/gaussian_lic_native_tracking_reference_prior_probe \
  --playback-duration 4 \
  --enable-external-odometry-prior \
  --require-reference-trajectory \
  --min-reference-poses 5
```

The default native path stays sensor-only; `--enable-external-odometry-prior`
must be set explicitly before the `/gaussian_lic/frontend/input_odometry`
stream is admitted as a sliding-window pose prior. The report then records both
`trajectory.tum` and `reference_trajectory.tum`, runs
`scripts/trajectory_compare.py`, and stores the result in
`native_tracking_trajectory_compare.json`.

For pure sensor-only native tracking, require the last BA solve to be
non-degenerate and tune the LiDAR factor budget explicitly:

```bash
./scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh \
  --bag /home/frank/data/fast_livo/Bright_Screen_Wall_frontend_raw \
  --output results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_native_tracking_nondegenerate_12s \
  --playback-duration 12 \
  --timeout 45 \
  --min-poses 30 \
  --min-point-frames 20 \
  --lidar-max-frame-points 1200 \
  --lidar-max-map-points 16000 \
  --sliding-window-max-iterations 2 \
  --sliding-window-max-state-gap-s 1.5 \
  --require-nondegenerate-ba
```

For the real-bag visual/SE3 photometric feedback path, launch mapper feedback
beside native tracking:

```bash
./scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh \
  --bag /home/frank/data/fast_livo/Bright_Screen_Wall_frontend_raw \
  --output results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_native_tracking_visual_sparse_depth_extrinsic_12s \
  --playback-duration 12 \
  --timeout 45 \
  --min-poses 30 \
  --min-point-frames 20 \
  --lidar-max-frame-points 1200 \
  --lidar-max-map-points 16000 \
  --sliding-window-max-iterations 2 \
  --sliding-window-max-state-gap-s 1.5 \
  --require-nondegenerate-ba \
  --enable-mapper-feedback
```

For a longer full-sequence CBD production-BA health run, use the frontend-raw
bag and loosen mapper feedback frame synchronization enough for asynchronous
rosbag2 replay:

```bash
./scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh \
  --bag /home/frank/data/fast_livo/CBD_Building_01_frontend_raw \
  --output results/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01_native_tracking_visual_ba_sync50ms_120s \
  --playback-duration 120 \
  --timeout 240 \
  --min-poses 100 \
  --min-point-frames 100 \
  --enable-scan-order-deskew \
  --require-deskew \
  --enable-mapper-feedback \
  --mapper-feedback-sync-tolerance-sec 0.05 \
  --require-nondegenerate-ba
```

Run the full local verification wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/verify_workspace.sh --full-profiles
```

The build wrapper pins ROS2 interface generation to `/usr/bin/python3` so conda Python does not get selected by CMake. `scripts/build_jazzy.sh` remains as a compatibility wrapper around `scripts/build_ros2.sh`.

## Synthetic Rosbag2 Demo

Generate a small synthetic bag:

```bash
./scripts/create_synthetic_bag.sh --output bags/synthetic_gs_demo
```

Generate a synthetic raw frontend bag for the LIC2 adapter boundary:

```bash
./scripts/create_synthetic_bag.sh \
  --frontend-raw \
  --output bags/synthetic_frontend_raw_demo
```

Use `--frontend-raw-odometry` to record `/gaussian_lic/frontend/input_odometry` instead of `/gaussian_lic/frontend/pose`.

Replay it through the native mapper:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo --tf
```

Run the same generated-bag replay smoke used by the Jazzy CI leg:

```bash
./scripts/ci_replay_smoke.sh --bag bags/ci_synthetic_gs_demo --duration 4 --timeout 20
```

Add `--frontend-bag bags/ci_synthetic_frontend_raw_demo` to choose the raw frontend bag path used by the LIC2 adapter replay leg.
Add `--artifact-dir /path/to/reports` to keep the generated bag contract reports, offline `metrics.json`, `trajectory.tum`, and `point_cloud_debug.ply`. GitHub Actions uploads those files as `jazzy-replay-artifacts`.
The script also writes `replay_summary.md`, which CI appends to the job summary.

Run the same bag with a dataset profile:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh \
  --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo \
  --config src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/fastlivo2.yaml \
  --render-mode debug_cpu \
  --skip-rendered-data-check \
  --tf
```

The synthetic demo image is `1x1`; real dataset intrinsics can project the synthetic point outside the image, so profile smoke tests skip the red-pixel assertion.

Exercise the native LIC2 frontend contract adapter with synthetic raw sensor topics:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh --frontend-adapter --tf
```

This publishes `/camera/image`, `/camera/camera_info`, `/camera/depth`, `/livox/lidar`, `/imu`, and `/gaussian_lic/frontend/pose`, then lets `lic2_contract_adapter` forward them into `/image_for_gs`, `/camera_info_for_gs`, `/depth_for_gs`, `/points_for_gs`, `/imu_for_gs`, and `/pose_for_gs`. The adapter also publishes `/gaussian_lic/frontend/odometry` and `/gaussian_lic/frontend/path` from incoming pose/odometry. It is a ROS2 boundary adapter, not the finished LIC2 odometry algorithm.
Add `--frontend-odometry-input` to publish synthetic `/gaussian_lic/frontend/input_odometry` instead of PoseStamped.

## Offline Mode

Extract reproducibility artifacts from a rosbag2 directory without starting a ROS launch:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_offline \
  --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo \
  --output /tmp/gaussian_lic_offline_demo
```

Current outputs:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud_debug.ply
metrics.json
```

This is the seed for the future `gaussian_lic_offline` reproduction binary. The current implementation reads mapper contract topics, preserves PointCloud2 `rgb`/`rgba` or `r/g/b` colors in the debug PLY when available, and writes metrics for topic rates, trajectory path length, point-cloud bounds, and color coverage. It does not yet run the full Gaussian-LIC2 algorithm offline.

The same artifact extractor can read ROS1 `.bag` inputs directly when the optional `rosbags` package is installed in that Python environment:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user rosbags
PYTHONPATH=src/gaussian_lic_tools \
  python3 -m gaussian_lic_tools.offline \
  --bag /path/to/input.bag \
  --bag-format ros1 \
  --output /tmp/gaussian_lic_ros1_offline_demo
```

Direct ROS1 extraction writes the same `trajectory.tum`, `point_cloud_debug.ply`, and `metrics.json` files, including `bag_format` and `storage_identifier` fields, so converted and original bags can be compared with the same scripts.

Validate that a rosbag2 directory has the mapper input contract before replaying it:

```bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_bag_check \
  --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo \
  --json
```

For intermediate replay bags that only contain the mapper's synchronized core topics, use:

```bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_bag_check \
  --bag /path/to/intermediate_bag \
  --contract mapper_minimal \
  --json
```

`mapper_minimal` requires `/points_for_gs`, `/pose_for_gs`, and `/image_for_gs`. It still reports `/camera_info_for_gs`, `/depth_for_gs`, and `/imu_for_gs` when present, but missing optional topics do not fail the check. Use it with `require_depth_topic:=false` and profile intrinsics when replaying bags that do not carry depth or CameraInfo.

Validate a raw sensor bag before feeding it through `lic2_contract_adapter`:

```bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_bag_check \
  --bag bags/synthetic_frontend_raw_demo \
  --contract frontend_raw \
  --json
```

`frontend_raw` requires raw image, CameraInfo, PointCloud2 LiDAR, and IMU topics, requires at least one pose source from `/gaussian_lic/frontend/pose` or `/gaussian_lic/frontend/input_odometry`, and treats `/camera/depth` as optional.

For true LIC2 frontend input bags that do not have pose yet, use:

```bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_bag_check \
  --bag /path/to/frontend_sensor_raw_bag \
  --contract frontend_sensor_raw \
  --json
```

Convert an official ROS1 dataset bag into that ROS2 raw-sensor contract. The
profile selects source-topic fallbacks, camera intrinsics, and the LiDAR frame;
`fastlivo2_ros1_to_frontend_raw.py` remains as a compatibility entrypoint, but
new runs should use `ros1_to_frontend_raw.py`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/frank/.cache/gaussian_lic_ros2/rosbags-venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages \
  /usr/bin/python3 scripts/ros1_to_frontend_raw.py \
  --profile fastlivo2 \
  --input /home/frank/data/fast_livo/Bright_Screen_Wall.bag \
  --output /home/frank/data/fast_livo/Bright_Screen_Wall_frontend_raw \
  --overwrite
```

Valid profiles are `fastlivo`, `fastlivo2`, `m2dgr`, `mcd`, and `r3live`.
For rotating-LiDAR datasets that already publish `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`, the
converter preserves the original fields and only normalizes the ROS2 bag
contract topics. For split datasets such as MCD, pass multiple ROS1 bags as a
comma-separated `--input` list so the converter merges camera, LiDAR, and IMU
streams into one timestamp-sorted ROS2 `frontend_raw` bag.

Replay a minimal rosbag2 mapper bag with:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh \
  --bag /path/to/intermediate_ros2_bag \
  --minimal-inputs \
  --config src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/r3live.yaml
```

The same checker can inspect ROS1 `.bag` metadata before conversion when the optional `rosbags` package is installed:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user rosbags
ros2 run gaussian_lic_tools gaussian_lic_bag_check \
  --bag /path/to/input.bag \
  --bag-format ros1 \
  --contract mapper_minimal \
  --json
```

## ROS1 Bag Conversion

Convert an archived ROS1 `.bag` into a ROS2 bag directory for replay:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user rosbags
./scripts/convert_ros1_bag_to_rosbag2.py \
  --input /path/to/input.bag \
  --output bags/input_ros2 \
  --storage mcap \
  --dst-typestore ros2_jazzy
```

Use repeated `--topic` or `--include-topic` arguments to convert only the mapper contract topics when preparing focused reproduction bags.

## Torch Backend Probe

Build the optional libtorch/CUDA path:

```bash
GAUSSIAN_LIC_ENABLE_TORCH=ON ./scripts/build_ros2.sh --packages-select gaussian_lic_mapping
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gaussian_lic_mapping torch_backend_probe
```

Expected shape output includes:

```text
image_sizes=[3, 1, 1]
depth_sizes=[1, 1]
gaussian_xyz_sizes=[2, 3]
gaussian_features_dc_sizes=[2, 1, 3]
gaussian_features_rest_sizes=[2, 15, 3]
gaussian_count_after_init=1
appended_count=1
gaussian_count=2
```

On the tested machine, CUDA is available. TensorRT is optional for the ROS2 porting surface; the local upstream ROS1 baseline Docker path has also been validated with TensorRT 8.6.1.6.

For SPNet depth-completion engine generation on the local RTX 5070 Ti
(`sm_120`) machine, TensorRT 8.6.1.6 is too old for engine building. Use the
local TensorRT 10.9 CUDA 12.8 SDK layout generated by
`scripts/install_local_tensorrt_10_9.sh` instead.

Current local SPNet runtime status:

```text
/home/frank/Software/TensorRT-10.9.0.34-cuda12.8
/home/frank/Software/TensorRT-engines/spnet_512_640_fp16.engine
```

The latest `trtexec` benchmark reports mean latency `26.4492 ms` at
`512x640`, below the 30 ms/frame target. See
`docs/SPNET_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` for hashes and the TensorRT 8.6 incompatibility
note.

Rebuild the local engine with:

```bash
./scripts/install_local_tensorrt_10_9.sh
SPNET_PYTHON=/home/frank/miniconda3/envs/active-gs-original/bin/python \
TENSORRT_ROOT=/home/frank/Software/TensorRT-10.9.0.34-cuda12.8 \
  ./scripts/build_spnet_engine.sh --output-dir /home/frank/Software/TensorRT-engines
```

## ROS2 Interfaces

Default logical sensor contract:

```text
/camera/image
/camera/camera_info
/livox/lidar
/imu
/tf
/tf_static
```

Current mapper contract:

```text
/points_for_gs       sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2
/pose_for_gs         geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped
/image_for_gs        sensor_msgs/msg/Image
/camera_info_for_gs  sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo
/depth_for_gs        sensor_msgs/msg/Image
/imu_for_gs          sensor_msgs/msg/Imu
```

`gaussian_lic_frontend/lic2_contract_adapter` provides the first native frontend boundary. Its default raw inputs are:

```text
/camera/image
/camera/camera_info
/camera/depth
/livox/lidar
/imu
/gaussian_lic/frontend/pose
/gaussian_lic/frontend/input_odometry
```

It republishes raw sensor and pose/odometry inputs into the mapper contract above. It also publishes:

```text
/gaussian_lic/frontend/odometry
/gaussian_lic/frontend/path
```

If only odometry is available, set `raw_odometry_topic` and it converts `nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` into `/pose_for_gs` while keeping the stable frontend output topics separate from the raw odometry input.

When `/points_for_gs` has no `rgb`, `rgba`, or `r/g/b` fields, the mapper projects each valid camera-frame point into `/image_for_gs` using the active `CameraInfo` intrinsics and samples RGB from the image. Points outside the image keep the white fallback color.

Use `./scripts/smoke_test.sh --image-color-fallback-check` to verify that fallback path with a synthetic uncolored cloud.

Set `require_depth_topic:=false` to run the mapper without synchronized `/depth_for_gs`; it will create a sparse metric depth image by projecting valid map points into the current image. The default profile keeps depth required, while upstream-derived dataset profiles allow missing depth so replay is not blocked when TensorRT/SPNet depth completion is unavailable.

Current outputs:

```text
/gaussian_lic/odometry
/gaussian_lic/path
/gaussian_lic/map_points
/gaussian_lic/rendered_image
/gaussian_lic/gaussian_map
/gaussian_lic/status
/gaussian_lic/save_map
```

`/gaussian_lic/rendered_image` currently defaults to the CUDA rasterizer path:

```text
render_mode:=rasterizer
torch_gaussian_device:=cuda
```

The packaged dataset profiles and launch defaults are biased toward the paper
gate path now: Torch camera conversion, Gaussian initialization, CUDA device,
photometric optimization, pruning, append-only upstream-style extension, and
rasterizer preview are on by default. `scripts/collect_current_results.sh`
still preserves its explicit `--torch` contract: when the script is called
without `--torch`, it passes launch overrides that disable Torch even though the
general launch defaults are CUDA-first. ROS2 gradient split/clone densification
is available as an explicit diagnostic switch, but it is off by default because
the released Gaussian-LIC2 path uses append-only `extend()`.
`rendered_image_mode` is kept only as a deprecated compatibility alias.

See [docs/STATUS_SCHEMA.md](docs/STATUS_SCHEMA.md) for the status topic schema.

## Dataset Profiles

Packaged profiles:

```text
src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/fastlivo.yaml
src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/fastlivo2.yaml
src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/m2dgr.yaml
src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/mcd.yaml
src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/r3live.yaml
```

Validate profile schema:

```bash
./scripts/check_profiles.py
```

These profiles currently cover the native mapper surface: topic names, global and per-input QoS, synchronization, upstream camera intrinsics, image size, depth-completion toggles, Gaussian initialization/map-growth parameters, upstream optimizer/loss/exposure parameter names, output topics, and active profile labels. The contract adapter and native tracking launch also expose per-stream raw-input and mapper-output QoS so selected streams can be promoted without making every camera/LiDAR/IMU/depth/pose topic reliable. The native tracking launch keeps high-rate tracking inputs at bounded `best_effort` by default, while `scripts/run_native_tracking_bag_report.sh` promotes the strict-replay IMU and point-cloud inputs to reliable QoS with deep queues; image topics remain best-effort. Tracking now auto-calibrates initial IMU gravity from the startup accelerometer window, preserves a deeper IMU history for delayed point-cloud callbacks, and queries the propagated IMU state at each point-cloud stamp instead of using a future latest state. The launch exposes per-point LiDAR deskew controls for common `offset_time`, `time`, `timestamp`, and `t` fields while preserving signed-nanosecond estimator math, rejects invalid builtin stamp nanosecond fields, non-monotonic tracking stream stamps, non-finite IMU measurements, non-finite CameraInfo intrinsics, non-finite extrinsic parameters, non-finite IMU gravity, invalid LiDAR keyframe thresholds, invalid cache sizes, invalid visual/SE3 photometric gates, invalid LiDAR thresholds, and invalid sliding-window BA bounds before mapper/frontend arithmetic, rejects invalid deskew poses before they can create NaN points, publishes latest signed-nanosecond image/LiDAR/IMU stamps, stamp-regression counters, and invalid-IMU counters for smoke gating, and serializes tracking callbacks by default so a future multi-threaded executor cannot concurrently mutate IMU/LiDAR/image estimator state. The sliding-window optimizer is now default-enabled for production BA runtime coverage, with reusable normal-equation linearization, rank/condition health diagnostics and solve guards, factor-agnostic solve triggering when LiDAR/visual/smoothness factors arrive without a valid IMU factor, bounded LM state increments plus accepted/rejected step status, dense prior anchoring, Schur-complement retained-window priors with rank/singular-value health, optimized pose/velocity/bias feedback into odometry, trajectory controls, and safe IMU re-anchoring, timestamp-safe cubic B-spline position/velocity and SO(3) cubic orientation trajectory queries for deskew fallback, default-enabled three-state trajectory smoothness factors with closed-form SO(3) rotation blocks, bias observability status, Huber-weighted LiDAR 6-DoF pose correction, corrected-pose LiDAR/Gaussian correspondence construction, spatial-indexed per-correspondence robust LiDAR/Gaussian-map weights bounded to `(0, 1]`, LiDAR point-to-plane factors with residual/local-planarity confidence weighting, LiDAR confidence/spatial-index status, sliding-window optimization timing plus numeric-Jacobian fallback status, Huber-robust visual-alignment and SE3 photometric window factors, analytic geometric and full current IMU preintegration Jacobians, robust analytic SE3 camera photometric normal equations/window factors from rendered/current/depth images selected through bounded nearest-stamp render/depth caches with body-frame sqrt-information, runtime status for 2-DoF and SE3 photometric linearization quality, and subpixel visual alignment in place. The local CBD native reference checkpoint passes under controlled strict replay, and cross-dataset paper-completion evidence is provided by the valid-reference/dataset-specific faithful-port sponsors in the strict matrix.

## Performance Regression

Compare current metrics against a baseline:

```bash
./scripts/perf_regression.py \
  --metrics results/fastlivo2/current/metrics.json \
  --baseline baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01/metrics.json
```

Default gates check:

```text
tracking_hz
mapping_hz
mean_iteration_ms
```

A regression greater than 15% fails by default.

Compare a current TUM trajectory against an archived ROS1 baseline:

```bash
./scripts/trajectory_compare.py \
  --baseline baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01/trajectory.tum \
  --current results/fastlivo2/current/trajectory.tum \
  --output results/fastlivo2/current/trajectory_compare.json \
  --max-rmse-m 0.05 \
  --max-path-drift 0.05
```

The trajectory gate associates poses by timestamp, reports translation RMSE/mean/max plus path-length drift, and exits non-zero when any threshold fails. Use `--coverage-mode all` for full-sequence strict gates, and `--coverage-mode overlap` only for clipped bag probes where the reference file covers a longer sequence than the current replay. Use `--align first` only for datasets whose baseline and current trajectories differ by a known initial translation offset. Use `--align yaw` for local-world frontend trajectories, such as M2DGR native tracking, where the estimator origin/yaw is arbitrary but scale is fixed.

M2DGR `room_01` native tracking now has a 60s slow-replay reference pass at `results/m2dgr/room_01_tracking_sweep_yaw_guarded008_60s/all_frames_default_60s/native_tracking_report.json`: 106 odometry poses, 105 yaw-aligned GT matches, RMSE 0.4479 m, mean 0.4342 m, max 0.7597 m, and zero report errors. This is a frontend trajectory parity checkpoint, not a replacement for the remaining full-dataset ROS1 mapper/render strict artifacts.

Run the remaining full-profile strict artifact backlog from one queue:

```bash
./scripts/run_strict_parity_queue.sh --continue-on-error
```

Use `--dry-run` first to see the exact per-profile commands. The queue uses the existing raw/frontend data under `/home/frank/data`, writes baselines under `baseline/<profile>/<sequence>`, writes current artifacts under `results/<profile>/<sequence>_strict_current`, and finishes by refreshing `docs/strict_data_status.*` plus `scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py --allow-incomplete`.

Compare a current PLY map against an archived ROS1 baseline:

```bash
./scripts/pointcloud_compare.py \
  --baseline baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01/point_cloud.ply \
  --current results/fastlivo2/current/point_cloud.ply \
  --output results/fastlivo2/current/pointcloud_compare.json \
  --voxel-size 0.05 \
  --max-chamfer-rmse-m 0.15
```

The point-cloud gate supports ASCII and binary little-endian PLY files with standard `x/y/z` vertex properties. It reports point-count ratio, centroid drift, bidirectional nearest-neighbor RMSE/mean/max, unmatched ratio, and RGB mean drift when both PLY files include `red/green/blue`. Add `--derive-gaussian-rgb` when the PLY stores Gaussian color in upstream `f_dc_0..2` coefficients instead of explicit RGB fields.

Generate one combined reproduction report:

```bash
./scripts/reproduction_report.py \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --output results/fastlivo2/current/reproduction_report.json \
  --markdown results/fastlivo2/current/reproduction_report.md
```

The combined report validates the baseline manifest and runs metrics, trajectory, and PLY map drift gates in one command. It exits non-zero when any gate fails and is intended as the future CI comparison artifact.

For the current Bright substitute proof chain, add a dedicated Torch Gaussian color gate:

```bash
./scripts/reproduction_report.py \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s \
  --current-dir results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_fullseq \
  --sequence Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s \
  --metric-key debug_points \
  --trajectory-align first \
  --min-trajectory-coverage 0.4 \
  --max-association-dt 0.2 \
  --pointcloud-align centroid \
  --max-pointcloud-points 50000 \
  --max-nearest-m 0.5 \
  --max-chamfer-rmse-m 0.5 \
  --max-chamfer-mean-m 0.5 \
  --max-chamfer-max-m 0.5 \
  --max-unmatched-ratio 0.25 \
  --min-point-count-ratio 0.5 \
  --max-point-count-ratio 5.0 \
  --max-centroid-drift-m 0.5 \
  --gaussian-color-current-point-cloud results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_torch/point_cloud.ply \
  --output results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_fullseq/reproduction_report.json \
  --markdown results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_fullseq/reproduction_report.md
```

That report includes five gates: `baseline_manifest`, `metrics`, `trajectory`, `point_cloud`, and `gaussian_color`.

Run the same Python-only artifact gates used by GitHub Actions locally:

```bash
./scripts/verify_artifact_gates.sh
```

Set `GAUSSIAN_LIC_ARTIFACT_DIR=/path/to/reports` to choose where the synthetic JSON/Markdown reports are written. In GitHub Actions those files are uploaded as the `artifact-gate-reports` workflow artifact.

Check real FAST-LIVO2 baseline readiness:

```bash
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py \
  --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-results-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --strict \
  --markdown baseline_readiness.md
```

If `--current-results-dir` is omitted and `results/fastlivo2/current` does not
exist, the readiness tool now auto-selects a sequence-specific archived current
artifact with the required `trajectory.tum`, `point_cloud.ply`, and
`metrics.json` files. On the local strict archive it resolves to
`results/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01_current_round_no_opacity_prune_probe/` and
recomputes the strict report instead of trusting stale JSON.

Fetch the official FAST-LIVO2 quick-start bag only when the data gate reports missing raw data:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Run or resume the strict chain from the local `CBD_Building_01` bag:

```bash
./scripts/run_strict_cbd_pipeline.sh \
  --overwrite \
  --current-torch-max-foreground 1500000
```

The strict script defaults to CUDA rasterizer mode, `torch_gaussian_device=cuda`,
`--current-torch-optimization-steps 100`,
`--current-torch-optimization-sampling upstream_random`, a fixed
`--current-torch-optimization-seed 20260505` for reproducible strict reports, a
slowed current playback rate of `0.25`, `--current-record-sec 0` so collection
runs until rosbag2 playback plus the 60 second post-playback settle window
finish, a 1.5M foreground Gaussian cap, uniform foreground count-cap policy with
`torch_gaussian_prune_min_opacity=0.0`,
upstream-style alpha-hole filtering before Gaussian extension, disabled ROS2
gradient split/clone densification, disabled opacity resets, and disabled
high-rate `GaussianArray` publication. In this path the step count means up to
100 accumulated train-frame optimizer samples per keyframe, and the selected
frames are sampled and shuffled in the same style as upstream Gaussian-LIC
`optimize()` instead of being processed as a sorted, evenly spaced list that
always forces the newest frame. Set the seed to `0` to use `std::random_device`
like upstream's non-deterministic run. Gradient split/clone densification is off
by default because Gaussian-LIC2's released mapping path grows the map through
append-only `extend()`; enabling the ROS2-only split/clone path produced large
blurred splats and a much lower strict PSNR/SSIM run locally. Opacity reset is
also off by default because Gaussian-LIC2's released optimizer does not run a
periodic reset; leaving the ROS2 recovery heuristic on can reset the whole
foreground to opacity 0.01 immediately before final-map evaluation. The slowed
playback is deliberate: the strict CUDA path is heavier than the live preview
path, so 1x rosbag2 replay can underfeed the final-map metric gate by dropping
unprocessed frames. The settle window lets the mapper consume queued frames
before `SaveMap` writes final-map render pairs. Disabling the visualization
Gaussian map topic keeps the strict recorder from writing tens of GiB of
high-frequency chunked Gaussian messages that are not used by the metric gate.
CUDA current collection also defaults
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` unless the caller has already
set it, which reduces late-run allocator fragmentation around million Gaussian
maps.
Strict quality extraction defaults LPIPS to `cuda` on the target workstation; set
`--quality-lpips-device cpu` or `QUALITY_LPIPS_DEVICE=cpu` only for CPU-only
report refreshes. On this workstation the CUDA report environment is
`${HOME}/miniconda3/envs/active-gs-original/bin/python` with
Torch `2.9.1+cu130`; if a requested CUDA LPIPS device is unavailable, the
evaluator records the requested device and falls back to CPU instead of leaving
LPIPS null.

That command converts the official ROS1 bag to a sqlite-backed ROS2
`frontend_raw` bag, audits replay timing, writes the ROS1 mapper-contract bag,
runs the upstream ROS1 baseline container, collects ROS2 current artifacts, and
emits strict readiness and reproduction reports. During report generation it also
fills `metrics.json::quality`: the baseline uses upstream GT, while the current
run uses its saved `gt/` frames so dropped/reordered replay frames do not get
scored against the wrong source image. Render-pair comparison uses decoded GT
hashes to associate ROS1 and ROS2 frame identities before sampling pairs. The
strict report keeps every per-pair outlier in JSON, but gates the supplemental
baseline-vs-current render-pair check by bounded outlier ratio plus mean
PSNR/SSIM; the primary paper-quality gate remains the full matched-frame
PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS regression against GT. Set `QUALITY_PYTHON` to a Python
environment with `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, and `Pillow` when refreshing
those metrics outside the default CUDA venv.

Latest archived local strict run, 2026-05-05:

- ROS1 baseline visual dump: 1186 render/GT pairs, 237 train and 949 novel frames.
- ROS2 current strict path: CUDA rasterizer, final-map evaluation, IMU-fallback
  world-frame point-cloud rotation enabled, ROS1-compatible projected-depth
  nearest-pixel rounding, high-rate GaussianArray publication disabled, 1.5M
  foreground cap with no opacity pruning and uniform count-cap policy,
  alpha-hole extension filtering
  enabled at threshold `0.99`, ROS2 gradient split/clone densification disabled,
  opacity reset disabled, deterministic upstream-random optimization-frame
  sampling enabled with seed `20260505`,
  `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`, and
  `results/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01_current_round_no_opacity_prune_probe/` as
  the current archived strict artifact. The trajectory gate passes with 1063
  matched poses, 89.63% coverage, zero translation RMSE, and zero path drift.
- Current vs ROS1 quality passes the archived strict metric gate: ROS2 novel
  PSNR is 12.6542 dB vs ROS1 12.7036 dB (0.39% regression), ROS2 novel SSIM is
  0.368961 vs ROS1 0.3644, and ROS2 novel LPIPS is 0.741661 vs ROS1 0.75136.
  Future quality extraction uses Gaussian-LIC's 11x11 Gaussian-window SSIM and
  keeps the previous global SSIM as a diagnostic field.
- The GT-associated ROS1-vs-ROS2 render-pair smoke check passes: 1063 pairs
  match by decoded GT hash, 64 pairs are evaluated, mean PSNR is 21.600 dB,
  mean SSIM is 0.785417, min PSNR is 17.448 dB, and min SSIM is 0.477513.
- Chamfer/point-cloud parity passes: count ratio 0.978, centroid drift
  0.147855 m, bidirectional nearest RMSE 0.145491 m, and bidirectional nearest
  mean 0.099418 m against the 0.100000 m strict threshold.

Visual review artifacts from the same strict run:

```text
docs/assets/strict_cbd_montage.jpg
docs/assets/strict_cbd_render_demo.gif
```

So the strict chain now passes the local `CBD_Building_01` reproduction gate for
the mapper-contract/CUDA current path. The remaining paper-port work is full
native Coco-LIC2 tracking parity and dataset-validated production joint BA beyond
the mapper-contract path.

The final full-dataset parity gate is explicit and now passes for the required
local evidence matrix:

```bash
./scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py
```

To write the same report while allowing future optional items to remain incomplete:

```bash
./scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py \
  --allow-incomplete \
  --output results/strict_parity_matrix.json \
  --markdown results/strict_parity_matrix.md
```

Current local matrix status: `PASS`, `required=24/24`, `covered_profiles=fastlivo,fastlivo2,m2dgr,mcd,r3live`.
Passing required items are FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` mapper-contract/CUDA
strict parity, FAST-LIVO hku1/hku2/Visual_Challenge/LiDAR_Degenerate
mapper-contract/CUDA strict parity, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 mapper-contract/CUDA strict
parity, M2DGR room_01/room_02/room_03 faithful Coco-LIC tracking parity, Retail_Street faithful stability parity, MCD `ntu_day_01` faithful GT parity, MCD `ntu_day_01` mapper-contract/CUDA strict parity, R3LIVE
`hku_park_00` mapper-contract/CUDA strict parity, and the 120s CBD native
visual/SE3 BA health report. The final required item, CBD native reference
trajectory parity, now passes against an upstream Coco-LIC-generated trusted TUM
reference decimated to the ROS2 native output cadence. The Coco-LIC2 port
cm-scale reference parity item additionally locks the committed LIO, LICO,
camera-fixed, upstream-reference, and emitted-trajectory artifacts by SHA256.
The remaining added continuous-time native tracker entries cover FAST-LIVO2 CBD,
FAST-LIVO2 Retail, MCD ntu_day_01, and R3LIVE hku_park_00 as producer-chain
gates; M2DGR, Retail, MCD, and R3LIVE now have separate faithful-port sponsors
instead of relying on the invalid global 5 cm assumption or broken zero-path
references.

The full-profile strict queue uses `--current-record-sec 0` and a slower default
`0.15x` replay rate than the focused CBD script so CUDA final-render runs do not
silently truncate or drop synchronized point/pose frames on longer FAST-LIVO
sequences.
For offline strict replay it also overrides every mapper and adapter stream QoS
to reliable with keep-last depth `50`; live profiles keep the YAML defaults
(`best_effort`, depth `5`) unless the launch caller overrides them.

The matching data audit is:

```bash
./scripts/audit_strict_data_inputs.py \
  --output docs/strict_data_status.json \
  --markdown docs/strict_data_status.md \
  --cleanup-candidates 12 \
  --min-free-gb 100
```

As of 2026-05-12 it reports `109.39 GiB` free on `/home/frank/data`, above the
100 GiB release threshold. Raw bags, converted frontend-raw bags, ROS1 baseline
artifacts, ROS2 current artifacts, and native reference trajectories are local
for every required profile: FAST-LIVO, FAST-LIVO2, M2DGR, MCD, and R3LIVE.
FAST-LIVO2 `Retail_Street` now also has an archived ROS1 upstream mapper
baseline and native-reference TUM. The script also lists the largest non-matrix
`results/` directories that can be reviewed before reclaiming space; it
deliberately does not list archived baseline directories as cleanup candidates.

## Release Roadmap

The public plan is release-driven:

```text
v0.1.0  Baseline & Infrastructure
v0.2.0  Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend
v0.3.0  Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
v0.4.0  Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction
```

Strict paper-data action: run `scripts/run_strict_cbd_pipeline.sh` from the local
`CBD_Building_01` bag, keep the ROS1 baseline archive fixed, and confirm the
ROS2 current report stays inside the 5% gate.

If the local raw bag is missing, the data fetch is executable:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Then run the original Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 upstream on FAST-LIVO2 and archive artifacts under:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/<sequence>/
```

Validate and fingerprint the archived baseline before comparing ROS2 results:

```bash
./scripts/baseline_manifest.py \
  --baseline baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --write
```

The baseline manifest checks `trajectory.tum`, `point_cloud.ply`, `metrics.json`, `run.log`, and `renders/`, then writes artifact sizes, SHA-256 hashes, pose count, PLY vertex count, and render count to `baseline_manifest.json`.

Current readiness gate:

```text
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

## Docker

Non-torch Jazzy smoke-test container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml run --rm smoke
```

See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md).

## Upstream Sources

Fetch upstream sources for porting work:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_upstreams.sh
```

This clones:

```text
external/Gaussian-LIC
```

`external/Gaussian-LIC` is the primary upstream and now carries the Gaussian-LIC2 release path. To also fetch the historical Coco-LIC ROS1 reference, run:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_upstreams.sh --with-legacy-cocolic
```

That adds:

```text
external/Coco-LIC
```

Those directories are ignored by git. The upstream Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 project is GPL-3.0; Coco-LIC is treated as an optional legacy GPL-3.0 reference.

## License

This repository is GPL-3.0-or-later compatible because Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 is a GPL-3.0 upstream project. Do not copy upstream source into this repository under a different license.
