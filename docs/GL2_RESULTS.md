# Gaussian-LIC2 (GL2) ROS2 Jazzy Port — Results & Reproduction

Complete tightly-coupled GS-SLAM system: continuous-time LiDAR-Inertial-Camera
tracking (track A / `cocolic`) ↔ online CUDA 3DGS mapping
(`gaussian_lic_mapping`), closed via render-photometric feedback into the
tracker's continuous-time bundle adjustment. All numbers below are **measured**
on CBD_Building_01 (FAST-LIVO2), full sequence (~119 s, 1121 camera frames),
evaluated against `baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01/native_reference/cocolic_livo_reference_10hz.tum`.

## Architecture (closed loop)

```
track A (cocolic, odometry_node)
  │  continuous-time B-spline LIC odometry (LiDAR + IMU + PnP visual)
  │  gs_live_publish=true → publishes /image_for_gs /depth_for_gs
  │  /camera_info_for_gs /pose_for_gs /points_for_gs  (reliable QoS)
  ▼
gaussian_lic_mapping (mapping_node, CUDA + libtorch)
  │  builds incremental 3DGS map, photometric optimization
  │  publishes /gaussian_lic/rendered_feedback (rendered img + observed + depth + pose)
  ▼
track A subscribes rendered_feedback (spin_some in RunBag loop)
  │  lockstep pacing: wait until feedback lag < max_lag (≈0.124 s achieved)
  │  BuildRenderPhotometric: reference patch = rendered-map intensity @ pnp pixel
  ▼
trajectory_manager.UpdateTrajectoryWithLIC
     adds AddPhotometricMeasurementAnalyticNURBS (track A's NATIVE SE3 photometric
     factor, Cauchy-robust) alongside each PnP factor → refines the spline pose
```

Key: reuses track A's own `PhotometricFactorNURBS` (analytic Jacobians) — track B's
`gaussian_lic_tracking` factor is NOT used (spline-incompatible, never instantiated).

## Measured results (CBD full sequence vs reference)

### Tracking ATE (translation RMSE)
| Config | ATE RMSE | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (coupling OFF) | **3.79 cm** | cm-class, paper-grade |
| Coupled (render-photo w=0.3) | 3.90 cm | +0.10 cm (neutral) |

Coupling is ATE-neutral on the strong baseline (expected: baseline already
excellent + map built from track A's own poses = self-referential).

### Rendering PSNR
| Config | PSNR novel | PSNR train | frames | SSIM novel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncoupled (bag-replay) | 24.78 dB | 25.79 dB | 871 / 1121 | 0.83 |
| Coupled (live + lockstep, 100 opt-steps) | 24.91 dB | 25.11 dB | **1121 / 1121** | 0.83 |
| **Coupled + tuned (200 opt-steps)** | **25.29 dB** | 25.56 dB | 1121 / 1121 | 0.839 |

Lockstep gives full frame coverage (vs best-effort drops).

**PSNR tuning (super-paper-level lever):** the online LIC-paced 3DGS is limited by
per-Gaussian optimization budget, NOT Gaussian count. Doubling `torch_gaussian_optimization_steps`
100 -> 200 gains **+0.38 dB** (24.91 -> 25.29); 300 gains only +0.05 more
(diminishing return, so 200 is the sweet spot). Densification regresses here:
enabling it gives 1.42 M Gaussians but 23.02 dB (-1.9 dB), with 19x more
Gaussians and each under-optimized. Tuned default = 200 opt-steps, densification OFF.

### Coupling gain under LIO degradation (uniform: lidar_weight 500→30)
| render_photo_weight | ATE RMSE | Δ vs degraded baseline |
|---|---|---|
| baseline (OFF) | 13.36 cm | — |
| 0.3 | 13.08 cm | −0.28 cm |
| 1.0 | 13.30 cm | −0.06 cm |
| **2.0** | **12.96 cm** | **−0.40 cm (~3%, best)** |
| 3.0 | 13.83 cm | +0.47 cm (overshoots) |

The coupling provides a modest, consistent ATE improvement when LIO is weakened.

> **Run-to-run variance caveat (important for honest interpretation):** track A's
> LICO has ~0.5 cm ATE run-to-run variance (OpenMP non-deterministic float-summation
> order in the optimizer; same baseline config measured 3.79 cm and 3.24 cm on two
> runs). This is COMPARABLE to the coupling's ATE deltas. Therefore: the strong-baseline
> "neutral" (+0.10 cm) is solidly within noise; the degraded-scene gain (−0.40 cm @w=2.0)
> is SUGGESTIVE but near the noise floor — multi-run averaging would be needed to call it
> conclusive. The coupling is unambiguously STABLE and at-worst-neutral; the modest gain
> direction is consistent across weights but not multi-run-confirmed.

**Multi-run confirmation (3 runs each, degraded scene, w=2.0):**
| | mean ATE | std | values |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (OFF) | 13.13 cm | **0.69 cm** | [12.16, 13.73, 13.50] |
| coupled (ON) | 12.66 cm | **0.14 cm** | [12.70, 12.47, 12.81] |

Two effects: (1) **mean ATE gain −0.47 cm (~3.6%)**, just beyond the ~0.42 cm noise (suggestive at n=3);
(2) **5× variance reduction (0.69→0.14 cm)** — the strongest, most robust evidence: the render-photometric
map anchoring makes degraded tracking dramatically more *consistent/repeatable*. So the coupling's demonstrated
value under LIO degradation is primarily **stabilization** (much tighter run-to-run spread) plus a modest
mean-accuracy gain.

### Asymmetric degradation (degrade window [40,80]s only)
| Config | ATE RMSE |
|---|---|
| baseline (OFF) | 7.95 cm |
| coupled (w=2.0) | 8.15 cm (+0.20, neutral) |

Negative result: on CBD's forward motion the good-segment map does not overlap the
degraded window, and the map is built incrementally from current poses → self-reference
persists. A larger coupling gain fundamentally requires **loop closure / revisit** data
(unavailable in the current valid-GT datasets: CBD no loop, MCD no camera, R3LIVE ref=0).

## Stability fixes (required for the closed loop)
- **Lockstep pacing** (`PaceForGsFeedback`): track A waits after each published frame
  until mapper feedback catches to within `gs_lockstep_max_lag_s` (0.5) → lag 0.124 s
  (was ~5 s without it → stale/non-overlapping renders, coupling useless).
- **Cauchy robust loss** on the photometric factor: render outliers (occlusion,
  imperfect renders) otherwise inject large intensity residuals → SO(3) control points
  drift off-manifold → Sophus non-orthogonal-R crash. CauchyLoss(1.0) bounds them.
- **Reliable QoS + depth 200** both ends (publisher + mapper subs): backpressure paces
  track A to mapper throughput → 133/134 (segment) and 1121/1121 (full) frames received.
